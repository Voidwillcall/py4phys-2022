    "- provide each class with a class method `from_id(id)` that takes as an argument the unique identifier of a particle and returns an *instance* of such particle! This is probably where you should take care of assigning the properties (charge, spin, mass etc.) of each elementary particle, but feel free to adopt more clever solutions!\n",
    "- Reminder: all particles except quarks can be observed in isolation. Stable particles are: up, down, electron, all neutrinos, gluon, photon."
